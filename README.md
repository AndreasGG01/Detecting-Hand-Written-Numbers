# Detecting-Hand-Written-Numbers
Using KNN, ANN and SVM models to classify hand written numbers. The experimentation also involved comparing results from raw data and results post feature extraction using Histogram-of-Oriented Gradient (HOG).

Classifier/Feature \tab HOG	        Raw Input

KNN	                    0.8676	    0.9705

SVM	                    0.9068	    0.9833

ANN	                    0.7116	    0.9785
