# Detecting-Hand-Written-Numbers
Using KNN, ANN and SVM models to classify hand written numbers. The experimentation also involved comparing results from raw data and results post feature extraction using Histogram-of-Oriented Gradient (HOG).

Results from the experimentation:

Classifier/Feature: KNN,	HOG:	0.8676, Raw Input: 0.9705

Classifier/Feature: SVM,	HOG:	0.9068, Raw Input: 0.9833

Classifier/Feature: ANN,	HOG:	0.7116, Raw Input: 0.9785
